# ChipsGame
A random number of chips are in the center between 2 players (or a user and the AI) and 
the goal of the game is to not grab the last chip in the pile. 

First thing before the game starts, the users enter their name(s). If a user wants to play with an AI, they simply
type AI for the second player and it's them against the computer.

Then a random number of chips (1-100) gets generated and the players are only allowed to take half of that number or less.
The players go back until the last chip is taken, whoever didn't grab the last chip won the game and user(s) are prompted
play again with the same people. 

As the users are playing the game, the winners are being placed in a separate txt file called "Winners" and that displays
the winners and how many moves they did to win. 

When the user quits the game, the console will display how many wins each player got in that round. For example, if a user
played against the AI for 4 games and the user won 3 times and the AI won 1 time, the console will display that the user won
3 times and the AI won 1 time in this round.

Enjoy playing!
